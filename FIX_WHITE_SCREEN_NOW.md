# ⚡ QUICK FIX: White Screen on Render

## ✅ THE FIX IS READY!

I've updated your `vite.config.js` to fix the 404 errors. Follow these steps:

## 🚀 3 Steps to Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Commit & Push (1 min)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd web-investments
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Configure Vite base path for Render"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Render to Redeploy (2-3 mins)

Render will automatically detect your push and start rebuilding.

**Check progress:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on your static site
3. Watch the deploy logs

**Wait for:** ✅ "Deploy live" message

### Step 3: Test Your Site (1 min)

1. Visit your Render URL
2. **Hard refresh:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. ✅ App should load correctly now!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Before (BROKEN):
```
❌ White screen
❌ 404 errors for animation-*.js
❌ 404 error for /vite.svg
```

### After (FIXED):
```
✅ App loads correctly
✅ All JavaScript files load
✅ All assets load properly
```

### The Changes:

**File: `client/vite.config.js`**
```javascript
// Added these lines:
base: '/',              // Fixes asset paths
assetsDir: 'assets',    // Organizes assets
```

This tells Vite to generate correct paths for Render.

## 🧪 Verification

After deployment, you should see:

✅ **No white screen** - App loads  
✅ **No 404 errors** in console (F12)  
✅ **All assets load** - Check Network tab  
✅ **App is functional** - Can navigate

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### 1. Clear Browser Cache

Do a **hard refresh:**
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

Or open in **Incognito/Private mode**

### 2. Check Build Logs

In Render Dashboard:
1. Click your static site
2. Click "Logs"
3. Look for "✓ built in XXXms"

### 3. Verify Settings

Make sure in Render:
- **Root Directory:** `client`
- **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory:** `dist`
- **Environment Variable:** `VITE_API_URL` is set

### 4. Manual Redeploy

If auto-deploy didn't trigger:
1. Render Dashboard → Your site
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. Select "Clear build cache & deploy"

## 💡 Why This Happened

Vite needs to know the base URL to generate correct asset paths. Without it:

```
Vite generates: /animation-C5f8MNnw.js
Browser tries:   https://yoursite.com/animation-C5f8MNnw.js
Result:          404 Not Found ❌
```

With the fix:

```
Vite generates: /assets/animation-C5f8MNnw.js
Browser tries:   https://yoursite.com/assets/animation-C5f8MNnw.js
Result:          200 OK ✅
```
