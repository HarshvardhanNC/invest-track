## ✅ What to Do Next

1. **Review the changes** made to understand the new structure
2. **For Render Static Site deployment:** Follow `client/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. **For Vercel deployment:** Follow `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` or `DEPLOYMENT_QUICKSTART.md`
4. **Set up environment variables** as per the templates
5. **Test your deployment** thoroughly before sharing

---

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Development:
- **Issue:** API calls not working locally
- **Solution:** Make sure you have a `.env.development` file with `VITE_API_URL=/api`

### Production:
- **Issue:** CORS errors in production
- **Solution:** Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend with your exact frontend URL (Render/Vercel)

- **Issue:** Environment variables not working
- **Solution:** Redeploy after adding/updating environment variables

- **Issue:** 404 errors on page refresh
- **Solution:** Make sure `_redirects` file exists in `client/public/` for Render

---

## 💡 Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They're in `.gitignore` for a reason
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Test locally first** before deploying
4. **Keep documentation updated** as you make changes
5. **Monitor your deployments** using platform dashboards
6. **Check logs** when things go wrong
