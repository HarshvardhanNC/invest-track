/* /index.html 200
```
✅ This file handles all client-side routing for your React app.

### Environment Variable Needed
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
```
✅ You'll set this in Render Dashboard during deployment.

### Build Configuration
```yaml
Root Directory: client
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
```
✅ These are the exact settings you'll use on Render.

## 🔍 Verification

### Files to Check

Run these commands to verify:

**Check _redirects exists:**
```bash
cat client/public/_redirects
```
Should output: `/* /index.html 200`

**Check build script:**
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```
Should create `dist/` folder successfully.

**Check environment variable:**
Look in `client/src/config/api.js`:
```javascript
baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || '/api',
```
✅ Already set up!

## 🧪 Pre-Deployment Test

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Navigate to client folder
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test development build
npm run dev
# Should run on http://localhost:5173

# Test production build
npm run build
# Should create dist/ folder
