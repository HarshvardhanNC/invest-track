# 🔧 Fix: 404 Errors for Static Assets on Render

## ❌ Problem

After deploying to Render, you see a **white screen** and these errors in the browser console:

```
animation-C5f8MNnw.js:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
/vite.svg:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

## ✅ Solution

This issue has been **FIXED** by updating `vite.config.js` with the correct base path configuration.

---

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The Vite build configuration was missing the `base` path setting, causing assets to be requested from incorrect URLs.

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `vite.config.js`

Added:
```javascript
base: '/',
assetsDir: 'assets',
```

This ensures:
- Assets are served from the correct root path
- All static files (JS, CSS, images) are placed in the `assets` folder
- Paths are resolved correctly on Render

### 2. Updated `render.yaml`

Added explicit content-type headers:
```yaml
- path: /*.js
  name: Content-Type
  value: application/javascript
- path: /*.css
  name: Content-Type
  value: text/css
```

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Commit the Changes

```bash
cd web-investments
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add base path config for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Trigger Redeploy on Render

**Option A: Automatic (if auto-deploy is enabled)**
- Render will automatically detect the push and redeploy
- Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete

**Option B: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Select your static site
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
4. Wait for the build to complete

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

1. Once deployed, visit your Render URL
2. **Hard refresh** the browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Check browser console (F12) - no 404 errors
4. The app should load correctly

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

After redeployment, verify:

- [ ] Site loads without white screen
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser console
- [ ] JavaScript files load correctly
- [ ] CSS styles are applied
- [ ] Images/SVG files display
- [ ] Can navigate the app normally
- [ ] Login/Register functionality works

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Clear Browser Cache

Sometimes browsers cache the old broken files:

1. **Hard Refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + R`
2. **Clear Cache:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode

### Check Render Build Logs

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your static site
3. Click **"Logs"**
4. Look for build errors

**Should see:**
```
Building for production...
✓ built in XXXms
✓ XXX modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   X.XX kB
dist/assets/index-XXXXX.css       XX.XX kB
dist/assets/react-vendor-XXXXX.js XXX.XX kB
dist/assets/animation-XXXXX.js    XXX.XX kB
...
```

### Verify Render Settings

Make sure these are set correctly:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Root Directory** | `client` |
| **Build Command** | `npm install && npm run build` |
| **Publish Directory** | `dist` |

### Check Environment Variable

Make sure `VITE_API_URL` is set in Render Dashboard:

1. Go to your static site
2. Click **"Environment"**
3. Verify `VITE_API_URL` exists
4. Value should be: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api`

## 📊 Technical Details

### Why This Happened

Vite uses the `base` option to determine how to generate asset paths:

- **Without `base`:** Vite uses absolute paths that might not match Render's serving structure
- **With `base: '/'`:** Vite generates paths relative to the root, which works correctly on Render

### The Fix Explained

```javascript
// Before (BROKEN)
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  build: { outDir: 'dist' }
})

// After (FIXED)
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/',              // ← Ensures correct asset paths
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  build: { 
    outDir: 'dist',
    assetsDir: 'assets'   // ← Organizes assets properly
  }
})
```

**What this does:**
- `base: '/'` tells Vite to serve assets from the root
- `assetsDir: 'assets'` puts all static files in one folder
- Render can now find and serve all assets correctly

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix (BROKEN)
```
Browser tries to load: https://yoursite.onrender.com/animation-C5f8MNnw.js
Render responds: 404 Not Found
Result: White screen
```

### After Fix (WORKING)
```
Browser tries to load: https://yoursite.onrender.com/assets/animation-C5f8MNnw.js
Render responds: 200 OK (file served)
Result: App loads correctly
```

---

## 🔄 Build Process After Fix

When you redeploy, Render will:

1. ✅ Clone your repository
2. ✅ Navigate to `client` directory
3. ✅ Run `npm install`
4. ✅ Run `npm run build` (with new config)
5. ✅ Generate `dist/` folder with correct paths
6. ✅ Serve files from `dist/`
7. ✅ All assets load correctly

---

## 📝 Local Testing

Before pushing, you can test the fix locally:

```bash
cd client

# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install

# Build with new config
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

Visit `http://localhost:4173` and verify:
- No 404 errors in console
- All assets load
- App works correctly

If it works locally, it will work on Render!

---

## 💡 Prevention

To avoid this in the future:

1. **Always set `base` in `vite.config.js`** for production builds
2. **Test production builds locally** with `npm run build && npm run preview`
3. **Check browser console** after every deployment
4. **Use hard refresh** to avoid cache issues

---

## ✅ Summary

**Problem:** 404 errors for static assets causing white screen

**Cause:** Missing `base` configuration in Vite

**Solution:** Added `base: '/'` and `assetsDir: 'assets'` to `vite.config.js`

**Action Required:** 
1. Commit and push changes
2. Wait for Render to redeploy
3. Hard refresh browser
4. Verify app loads correctly

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix 404 errors on Render"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for Render to deploy** (2-3 minutes)

3. **Test your site** - should work now!

---

**The fix is ready!** Just push the changes and redeploy. 🎉

If you still have issues after following these steps, check the troubleshooting section in `client/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`.

**Questions?** Double-check that:
- Changes are committed and pushed
- Render has redeployed (check dashboard)
- You've done a hard refresh in browser
- Environment variables are set correctly
